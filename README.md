# bpf2c: convert eBPF bytecode to C code



## Overview

`bpf2c` is a specialized tool designed to streamline the process of converting eBPF byte code into C code. This tool is an essential part of the workflow when working with eBPF programs, particularly in scenarios where the goal is to ensure that the eBPF byte code is sandboxed, verified, and safely integrated into larger applications.

## Key Features

- **ELF File Parsing:** `bpf2c` takes an ELF file as input, automatically extracting the list of maps and stored eBPF programs. 
- **eBPF Verification:** The tool interfaces with the eBPF verifier, ensuring that the byte code adheres to the strict safety guarantees required by the eBPF execution environment. This includes constraints on instruction count and termination guarantees.
- **Instruction-Level Translation:** Each eBPF instruction is translated into its equivalent C statement, enabling deeper integration with C-based systems.
- **Skeleton Code Generation:** `bpf2c` emits skeleton C code that includes the necessary hooks for relocation operations during runtime. This skeleton code is essential for ensuring that the eBPF program can be properly loaded and executed within the target environment.
- **Integration with MSBuild:** For ease of use, the tool is packaged with a PowerShell script that not only invokes `bpf2c` but also integrates with MSBuild to streamline the build process in environments using Microsoft's build system.

## Build

```sh
make
```
